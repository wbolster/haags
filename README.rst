Haags
=====

A Python library to programmatically "translate" Dutch text into the
"Haags" dialect, as spoken in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands.
It aims to transform well-written Dutch text into the dialectal
spelling, as popularized by the Haagse Harry comics written by Marnix
Rueb.

**DO NOT USE**: This code is pre-alpha quality, and should not be used
by anyone but the author.
